Wikinews is a news website written by thousands of people around the world! You can collaborate by visiting https://wikinews.org/

This repository is part of work to allow Wikinews readers to easily access their favorite categories.

## Background

The most useful way to find current articles is by going to the categories. However, the categories are not easily found using the current search system, they are not displayed on the mobile version, and novice readers may not understand the organization of the project.

## Current situation

This project is in beta phase.
